# KEO CLS.EEDI

This is the documentation of the KEO CLS.EEDI protocol. KEO CLS.EEDI allows energy grid related backend systems (e.g. aEMT) to exchange energy management related data with local systems (e.g. SMGWs).

# Collaboration Guidelines

Requests for collaboration will be welcomed. We are very interested to get input from all involved parties and commit to
moderate discussions on CLS.EEDI within the community. The safest mode of collaboration in this repository is to start a
discussion first. For this, either open an issue here on GitHub or write an email to cls.eedi@keo-connectivity.de.

If you open a pull request on GitHub make sure to update all related files. For most changes you will need to update
the descriptions in [docs/clseedi.md](https://github.com/KEO-cls-eedi/specification/blob/main/doc/clseedi.md), update
the JSON schema files in [schemas/](https://github.com/KEO-cls-eedi/specification/tree/main/schemas) and
[schemas/clseedi/](https://github.com/KEO-cls-eedi/specification/tree/main/schemas/clseedi/), and update the example
JSONs in [schemas/clseedi/examples/](https://github.com/KEO-cls-eedi/specification/tree/main/schemas/clseedi/examples).
